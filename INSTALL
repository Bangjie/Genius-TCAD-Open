Install from source code
========================

This section describes how to install from source code taken direct
from git@github.

First, download source from git@github.

Now change directories in to the top-level source directory (where this
INSTALL file can be found).

The project uses the GNU build process. This is still very crude and needs
work, but basically you should be able to do the following:
$ acloal
$ autoheader
$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

At present it is normal for there to be some warning generated during this
process.


If a problem is found with the build proccess, please submit a report to me.
Please provide information about you system
and any ./configure arguments you are using, together with any error
messages.  Ideally you would have tried to fix the problem yourself first,
and details about this and any thought you may has as to the cause of the
problem should also be provided.  If you have fixed the problem then the
development team will love to hear from you.


Basic Installation
==================
This covers installation from a tar-ball (for example genius-1.6.tar.gz).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, you should prepare some libraries genius dependent.
	1 the latest petsc-3.0.0 is recommended.
	2 cgnslib-2.5, earlier version has memory leak problem.
	3 Optional: VTK-5.4.2 However, you can still export VTK file with ascii format if you do not have VTK lib.

The compiling of PETSC requires you to set two system variables:
'PETSC_DIR' point to the directory of PETSC.
'PETSC_ARCH' to give a tag of PETSC configuation.
GENIUS configure script will check PETSC_DIR to determin if PETSC installed.

The default installation directory of cgns and vtk are /usr/local,
GENIUS configure script will check this directory for cgns and vtk.
It means if you install cgns/vtk by their default directory, GENIUS
can find them automatically.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second, make sure your compiler works, flex (version 2.5.4a, no 2.5.3x) and bison (version >=2.0, no 1.8x) are also needed.

Note 1:
Although gcc version 3.4~4.3 have been tested ok, vendor compiler (such as Intel icc on PC)
works much faster (50% faster than gcc). That mainly because the math library
used by gcc compute pow(x,y) in an inefficient way but icc seems using a hardware
float point arithmatic accelerator.

Note 2:
Intel icc 9.x has a bug: nan==nan is considered as true, which breaks all the nan test.
Fortunately, Intel icc 10.x has corrected this bug.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to set environment GENIUS_DIR point to the directory of genius.
for example, under bash:
	export  GENIUS_DIR=/home/gdiso/genius

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After downloading the tar ball to a local directory unpack it using:

$ tar -zxf genius.tar.gz

Now change directories in to the top-level source directory (where this
INSTALL file can be found).

Generate the configure script by auto-conf tools
$ acloal
$ autoheader
$ autoconf

Then, you should be able to do:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Note 1:
If cgns lib is not installed at /usr/local, you need to add argument "--with-cgns=<cgns_path>"
cgnslib.h should be found at <cgns_path>/include
libcgns.a should be found at <cgns_path>/lib

Note 2:
"make install" will copy binary file to GENIUS_DIR/bin and material data files to GENIUS_DIR/lib

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If everything is ok, add GENIUS_DIR/bin to your path.
You can goto example directory to check genius.
	genius -i xxxx.inp
for parallel version
        mpiexec -n x genius -i xxxx.inp
